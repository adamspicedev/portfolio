Recently, I encountered a problem where Node.js being single-threaded became a bottleneck. To overcome this, I decided to explore multi-threading using worker threads. Here’s a walkthrough of my approach.

### Setting Up the Express Server

I started by creating a simple Express server to test the effectiveness of worker threads. Here’s the initial setup:

```JavaScript
const express = require("express");

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get("/no-block", (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).send("No block here");
});

app.get("/block", (req, res) => {
    let counter = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 20_000_000_000; i++) {
        counter++;
    }

    res.status(200).send(`result is ${counter}`);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

In this setup, there are two endpoints:

<ol>
  <li>/no-block: Returns a string immediately.</li>
  <li>
    /block: Performs 20 billion iterations before returning a result, simulating
    a heavy computation.
  </li>
</ol>
Timing the blocking endpoint results in the following: ``` time curl --get
http://localhost:3000/block 17.382 total ``` As expected, this is far too slow.
Now, let's try to speed it up using worker threads.

### Introducing Worker Threads

First, I created a new file called `worker.js`:

```JavaScript
const { parentPort } = require("node:worker_threads");

let counter = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 20_000_000_000; i++) {
    counter++;
}

parentPort.postMessage(counter);
```

This worker moves the blocking code into a separate thread and returns the result after the loop completes. The performance remains the same:

```
time curl --get http://localhost:3000/block 17.333 total
```

### Multi-Threading with Worker Threads

To further improve performance, I updated `worker.js` to support multi-threading:

```JavaScript
const { workerData, parentPort } = require("node:worker_threads");

let counter = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 20_000_000_000 / workerData.thread_count; i++) {
    counter++;
}

parentPort.postMessage(counter);
```

And made corresponding updates to `index.js`:

```JavaScript
const express = require("express");
const { Worker } = require("node:worker_threads");

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const MAX_THREADS = 8;

function createWorker() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const worker = new Worker("./worker.js", {
            workerData: {
                thread_count: MAX_THREADS,
            },
        });
        worker.on("message", (data) => {
            resolve(data);
        });
        worker.on("error", (error) => reject(error));
        worker.on("exit", (code) => {
            if (code !== 0) {
                reject(new Error(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`));
            }
        });
    });
}

app.get("/no-block", (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).send("No block here");
});

app.get("/block", (req, res) => {
    const workerPromises = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < MAX_THREADS; i++) {
        workerPromises.push(createWorker());
    }

    Promise.all(workerPromises)
        .then((data) => {
            const total = data.reduce((acc, value) => acc + value, 0);
            res.status(200).send(`Total: ${total}`);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            console.error(error);
            res.status(500).send("Internal server error");
        });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

You can adjust the `MAX_THREADS` variable to suit your computer. I have 12 cores, so I used 8. To find out the number of cores on your machine, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

<ul>
  <li>MacOS: `sysctl -n hw.ncpu`</li>
  <li>Linux: `nproc`</li>
  <li>Windows: `echo %NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS%`</li>
</ul>
The results speak for themselves: ``` time curl --get
http://localhost:3000/block 2.037 total ```
